To make inputs enter any numbers shown in the terminal
For example if the game asks you if you want to go left(1) or right(2)
entering 1 into the terminal will make you go left and entering 2 into the terminal will make you go right.

There are 3 classes you cam choose
The barbarian: Good for taking lots of damage as they have high health and can become even more of a tank with armor upgrades

The fighter: A good all rounder which has good armor, preferably focus on upgrading attack 

The rogue: high attack and speed allow for dealing high damage and dodging incoming damage and traps, can focus on either
    upgrading attack to end fights before you take too much damage or armor to have a little more sustainabilty in fights

There will be a total of 10 Rooms on each floor
The left path will have 4 Rooms which could be an Item, Trap, Monster, Shop and one extra room at the end as an exit
The right path follows the same rules as the left 

As you traverse rooms you do not have to backtrack through them if you want to journey through the other path
In shops you can spend your hard earned gold on upgrades or to rest to set your health back to max

When you reach an Item room you will automatically use it to upgrade your stats
    There is something in the brine. Pickles can overheal you, make sure not to rest as it will set your health back to max

There are many monsters you can face, the most powerful of the bunch will have better rewards but its not always advised to fight it
    If you flee from a fight you wont have to fight that monster later

Traps will be hidden as another Room type so be careful, when you enter a trap Room you will automatically try to dodge the trap 
    based on your speed

Every 4 floors you complete the monsters will get harder but will grant you more xp and gold

Every time you level up you will need exponentially more xp to level up

Keep going until your inevitable fate meets its end
